## Packages

-   I co-maintain [`{worldfootballR}`](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR), an R package for extracting world football (soccer) data from several sites.
-   I wrote [`{fotmob}`](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/fotmob), an R package for retrieving soccer data from [Fotmob](https://www.fotmob.com/).
-   I wrote [`{valorantr}`](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/valorantr), an R package for retrieving pro Valorant data from [rib.gg](https://rib.gg/).
-   I have contributed to [`{ffscrapr}`](https://github.com/ffverse/ffscrapr/), an R API client for several fantasy football league platforms.

I'm currently working on making an unofficial API for [GeeksWhoDrink](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/gwd), using python.
